# Project

This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The aim was to write a [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) spec that would test the reader and ensure the code was working. Udacity provided most of the files and started the Jasmine file which was to be completed.


## Instructions

Download the file and open the index.html in a browser. The page should loas a RSS feed which has a menu, allowing you to change the content shown on the page. Jasmine test results should display at the bottom of the page.

# Acknowledgments
